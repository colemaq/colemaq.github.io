        <h2>What is ColemaQ?</h2>
        <div class="text">
            ColemaQ is a mod of Colemak-DH which aims to improve
            the typing experience by reducing SFB's and modifying
            punctuation placements. Variant's of ColemaQ try to
            give room for further improvements upon ColemaQ,
            however the main version of ColemaQ gives all the
            original benefits with only four changes from Colemak-DH.

		<h2>Changes implemented</h2>

		<h3><b>Why is the Q on the other side?</b></h3>
        <div class="text">
            The Q change allows <code>;</code> to have a better position during
            quotes but lessening movement of the left pinky in text
            and also adding a <code>qu</code> bigram roll.

            Less distance for the left pinky while scoring better
            in analyzers. Similar ideas of improving bigrams are
            throughout the layout.
        </div><br>

        <h3><b>What's the rationale behind the <code>VK</code> swap?</b></h3>
        <div class="text">
			This is to break up the <code>nk</code> same finger bigram found
            in Colemak-DH for words such as think and know.
			This move is only possible by removing the boundary
            of keeping QWERTY shortcuts in their original positions.
        </div><br>

        <h3><b>Why has the punctuation been rearranged?</b></h3>
        <div class="text">
            The <code>e,</code> bigram is fairly common when typing English.
            This mod helps to further reduce same finger bigrams.
            There's also reduced movement of the <code>e</code> and <code>a</code> columns
            because of the punctuation moves, regardless how seemingly
            small.
        </div><br>

        <h3><b>Symbols modification</b></h3>
        <div class="text">
            The symbols in the top right of the keyboard have been
            rearranged. This makes the commonly used hyphen easier
            to reach. The <code>=</code>/<code>+</code> key has also been placed in a better
            position.
